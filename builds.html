            Start with leveling up your abilitys and what order you should level up/max. 
            Most games should look somthing like this (image shown below) but games can vairy slighty depening on matchups
            and certain situations. Your starting items will also depend on diffeerent situations and also different matchups in the game.
        </p>
        <p id="para10">
            This build is best for when you are ahead in lane and in the game. For example you are a kill
            ahead in lane or you are up in farm by a substantail amount. Another reason you could build this
            is if the rest of your team doesn't have to much damage so you will be counted as being the damage
            dealer for you team. Maybe you just want to beam the enemy down!

            This build is best when you want to paly defensive and safe. Maybe you dont feel confidant
            that you are going to win your lane/matchup. Another posibble reason you might want to build
            defensive is becuase they have alot of poke/damage on the enemy team and you fear you are going to
            get poked down alot by the poke damage. I have put and alt to Banshee's Veil in case there team is
            more AD then AP. If they are more AD then the best option would be Zhonya's Hourglass but if they
            are more AP then Banshee's Veil will work fine.
        </p>
        <p id="para14">
            This build is best for when they enemy team has a lot of tanky champ's. It is good as even
            if you do not kill them you will heavily damage then. Meaning that your team can finish them off 
            easily and kill them. This will be really good for your team if you do not have a tank yourself.
