            This is going to be a helpful guide/tips to play Vel'Koz in the midlane and what builds you can go.
            On this website i will also tell you what the best matchups and the worst matchups are for Vel'Koz Mid.
            A brief discribtion of Vel'Koz and what he does, Vel'Koz's <abbr title="Life Form Disintegration Ray"><b>Ultimate R</b></abbr>
            unleashes a channelled beam that follows the cursor for 2.5 seconds that deals magic damage.
            Organic Deconstruction Researches enemy champions causing them to take true damage instead.

            A brief mention on his lore It is unclear if Vel'Koz was the first Void-spawn to emerge on Runeterra, 
            but there has certainly never been another to match his level of cruel, calculating sentience. While his kin devour or defile everything around them, 
            he seeks instead to scrutinize and study the physical realm—and the strange, warlike beings that dwell there—for any weakness the Void might exploit. 
            But Vel'Koz is far from a passive observer, striking back at threats with deadly plasma, or by disrupting the very fabric of the world itself.

        <p id="para2"><b>EARLY GAME </b> - Vel'Koz's level 6 is a massive powerspike as it lets him utilize his <abbr title="Organic Deconstruction"><b>passive</b></abbr> fully. 
            It is a great finishing ability that is best used against enemies who are clumped together. His first item will give a massive boost to his overall effectiveness in the lane. 
            It will increase his burst damage combo, and he can force enemies to recall abruptly quite frequently in the lane. </p>
        <p id="para3">
        <b>MID GAME </b> - He will have two points in his <abbr title="Life Form Disintegration Ray"><b>Ultimate R</b></abbr> once he hits level 11.
        This means that Vel'Koz will use the <abbr title="Life Form Disintegration Ray"><b>Ultimate R</b></abbr>
        more efficiently as a finishing move to get rid of low health targets.Team fights are going to be really good for Vel'Koz due to his kit.
         If he manages to score a knock upon a target, he will probably kill them instantly with his team.
        </p>
        <p id="para4">
            <b>LATE GAME </b> - At level 16, Vel'Koz will have his <abbr title="Life Form Disintegration Ray"><b>Ultimate R</b></abbr> 
            maxed out. This means that he can now deal tons of damage from far away even if he gets one stack of his Passive on his enemy.
            His damage output will be really high due to the number of items he possesses at that point in the game. 
            He should focus on using the fog of war to poke out enemies first.
            Vel'Koz will be extremely good in team fights, especially fights where he is playing around choke points. 
            This means that he can apply his <abbr title="Organic Deconstruction"><b>passive</b></abbr> stacks on multiple enemies, making it easier for him to kill a bunch of enemies together.
