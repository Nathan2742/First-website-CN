            Matchups can be tricky when playing Vel'Koz as he is a high damage champion but 
            he is also very immobile. Making him easy to kill and pick him off if not in the greatest
            position in team fights or just fights in general. However agasint some picks in lane can
            really benifit you and your team if you are agasint the right enemy champ/team comp.
            So here i will tell you the picks that are strong agaisnt Vel'Koz and the picks that 
            are weak agasint Vel'Koz.
